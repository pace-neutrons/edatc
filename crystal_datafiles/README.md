# Data files for single crystal examples

These files are too large to be stored in github directly.
They are instead available in a [Zenodo dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5020485).

The files are compressed into a single 1G 7zip archive.
To use, please download the [archive](https://zenodo.org/record/5020485/files/crystal_datafiles.7z?download=1)
and extract the file into this folder.

# Contents

The compressed archive contains:

- `map*nxspe` - reduced ToF INS datafiles for a bcc-Iron experiment on MAPS.
- `MER18519_Ei50.00meV_One2One.nxspe` - a measurement of CuGeO3 on MERLIN.
- `upd3_elastic.sqw` - a subset of a dataset on UPd3 measured on MERLIN.
- `spurious[12].sqw` - subsets of data showing spurious scattering.
